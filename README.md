Monolith Carousel animation 
Please find included.

Most functionality was created using HTML and css and some javascript.
The CTA specifications of how much spacing was required was not clear. So I added enough to show a change
The animation of the carousel was done mostly with CSS. I have added some javascript for the purpose of possibly creating a pause button for additional accessiblity
and User Experience.
